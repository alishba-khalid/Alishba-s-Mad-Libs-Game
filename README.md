This is a fun and interactive command-line game built using Python. The program prompts the user for a series of words, such as an adjective, an animal, or a verb. It then takes these words and inserts them into a pre-written story template to generate a unique and humorous Mad Libs story.

This project is a great demonstration of foundational Python skills, showcasing a clear understanding of:

User Input: Effectively gathering information from a user through the command line.

String Manipulation: Using f-strings to dynamically insert user-provided words into a story template.

Code Organization: Structuring the program with functions to ensure the code is modular, readable, and easy to maintain.

Features
Interactive Prompts: Guides the user with clear instructions for each word needed.

Dynamic Story Generation: Creates a new story each time the game is played based on user creativity.

Simple Command-Line Interface: Easy to run and play for users of all technical levels.

Robust Code Structure: Organized into functions for collecting input, generating the story, and running the main game loop, making it simple to extend or modify.
